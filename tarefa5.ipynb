Like they would say shit about Islam or Muslims (which would more often than not be wrong or taken out of context) then not even mention things like colonialism, the CIA overthrowing half their governments or the little fact that America being a biiiig supporter of all the groups they claim to hate. I\\'m guessing that\\'s one of the reasons they hate \"woke education in universities\"/ \\n\\nThey talk about how horrible feminism is but fail to mention the things it\\'s actually done like give women, aka half the worlds population, more rights than ever which has allowed many societies to prosper. They want to actively go against that but also shit on countries like Saudi Arabia for preaching the same thing but praise Russia which is arguably way worse when it comes to the treatment of women. I kept asking myself why until I realized the obvious answer, it\\'s a white country and everything they say is engrained with racist undertones meant to make who they deem as \"lesser\" or \"savages\" look as bad as possible based strictly on their skin color. \\n\\nWhich is funny because for people who preach about \"Western civilization\" and \"Western values\", they sure do seem to hate both of those things and want to take back to a non-existent past. Like how far back do they want to go because a lot of what they preach goes against \"Western values\" even of the past and more I thought about it, the more I realized they would have to passed the enlightenment, passed Rome and even passed Greece to get to their \"perfect world\". \\n\\nAnd it really goes on and on, them denying climate change was also a big one, but I think the biggest thing was just how massive cry babies they all are and how they managed to convince people it\\'s actually the left because of how well they stick together. Like all they do is whine and bitch and moan about cancel culture, the \"woke left\", cringe LGBTQ+ people/content online, Muslims, black people, Socialism etc. They don\\'t actually have any platforms or ideas except being against what ever is actively moving people forward and cutting taxes on the rich, who just happens to fund them.
